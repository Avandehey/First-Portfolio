            </div>
			<p>A life long computer nerd, i fell in love with the computer since the first moment i owned one. now hoping to follow a career in programing, im well on my way to spending a life dedicated to working with my computer.</p>
            <p><br>I was Born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. I grew up in both california and Germany. My family traveled a lot in my childhood, alwasy on a new adventure.</br></p>
            <p><br>At 19 i moved up to Oregon to learn how to farm. From there ive worked automechanics, cooked, and i even worked as a flight attendant for a time. The few years before becoming a programer were spent working as an electrician and learning the fundementals of electricity.</br></p>
            <p><br>Ive dedicated myself to learning how to become a hard worker, no matter the task. All in all the best advice i can ever give to anyone is the man that learns how to sweep will be useful no matter what.</br></p>

			<h2>Past Experience</h2>
			<div class="experience-item">
				<h3>Flight Attendant</h3>
				<p>As a flight attendant i became a master of customer service. In my few years of service i have had 2 medical emergencies in the sky, and several spilled drinks. The Flight Attendant life is a Nomad lifestyle, alwasy on the move and at times very lonely. On the job there was never a dull moment but im thankfull for no longer having to deal with the stresses of the job.</p>

			<div class="experience-item">
				<h3>Electrician</h3>
				<p>The Trades will make or break a man. As an electrician i learned the art of working with your hands. Every day there was a new problem to solve and i always loved the challenge. Electricity does not seem to follow common sence and at times can be a tricky thing to understand. Learning the trade has also taught me how to be resourcefull at home with house projects and just how to be handy in general.</p>
